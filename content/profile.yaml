  about: |
    Current OMS I student and a member of a scientist physician track at RVUCOM. I enjoy working in the lab and hope to accelerate my skills in research.

    Away from school I am a mother, wife, and avid traveler. Anytime there is a break from school, we all pack into the car and explore the outdoors. ðŸ™‚
